# Emotion-recognisation-system
Emotional-Feedback-System
This repository contains Untitled2.ipynb, a supplementary Jupyter Notebook related to emotion detection. This notebook may include exploratory data analysis, alternative models, or additional data processing techniques to enhance emotion classification.

Features

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) for emotion detection

Preprocessing techniques and feature engineering

Alternative model experimentation

Performance visualization and evaluation

Emotion-based response generation or action suggestions

What Happens After Emotion Recognition?

Once the model classifies an emotion, the notebook may include:

Personalized responses: Generating text-based responses based on detected emotions.

Sentiment-based recommendations: Suggesting music, movies, or activities based on mood.

Alerts or notifications: Sending warnings if negative emotions like stress or sadness are detected.

Visualization of emotion trends: Displaying emotion trends over time to understand behavioral patterns.

Usage

Run each cell sequentially to execute data processing and model training steps.

Modify hyperparameters or models as needed for experimentation.
Analyze visualizations to understand model performance.
Explore the post-recognition actions implemented within the notebook.

Dependencies
